# EECS-6322-Project
EECS 6322 WI 2023 Reproducibility challenge
This project is inspired1 by the Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge
(https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020/task). The aim of this project is to
replicate the central claim in a selected deep learning focused paper. This
will include re-implementing the core methods and experiments in the paper

# Abstract
In this project, we present a reproduction study of the paper "TransMatcher: Deep Image Matching Through Transformers for Generalizable Person Re-identification". We implemented the TransMatcher using PyTorch (on top of QAConv-GS as mentioned in the paper) and reproduced the experiments on three different person re-identification benchmarks. We evaluated the model's performance using the mean average precision (mAP), and Rank-1 metric and compared our results to those reported in the original paper.
